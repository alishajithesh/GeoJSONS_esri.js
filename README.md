# Mega Cities Map

This project visualizes the mega cities of the world using the ArcGIS JavaScript API, leveraging a GeoJSON layer to represent city data. The map features an interactive interface, displaying cities with customizable symbols styled using a `SimpleRenderer`. Visual variables are applied to adjust the size of city markers dynamically, based on specified attribute values. 

The application demonstrates the integration of web-based GIS technologies for data visualization, including the use of basemaps, custom renderers, and interactive map views. It serves as a foundation for further exploration and development of geographic applications for data presentation and analysis. 

Ensure that the GeoJSON file is publicly accessible for the application to function correctly. For any issues, check the console logs for debugging information.
